# How Cassandra Does It

## Key Components

### 0. Mutation

Unlike a traditional application that thinks in terms of "set this variable," Cassandra thinks in terms of **Mutations**.

A client request such as:

```text
PUT(user123, "John")
```

is internally converted into a Mutation object:

```java
Mutation {
    key = "user123"
    value = "John"
    timestamp = 1719581011000
    ttl = null
}
```

A Mutation contains much more than just the key and value. It also stores metadata required for replication and conflict resolution, including:

* Partition Key
* Timestamp
* TTL (if specified)
* Deletion/Tombstone information
* Table metadata
* Other internal metadata

### Multiple Versions

Suppose another request arrives:

```text
PUT(user123, "Alice")
```

This also becomes a completely new Mutation.

```java
Mutation {
    key = "user123"
    value = "Alice"
    timestamp = 1719581025000
}
```

**Important:**

* The old value is **not immediately overwritten on disk.**
* Cassandra follows an **append-only** storage model.
* Multiple versions of the same key can temporarily exist simultaneously.
* During reads, the mutation with the **latest timestamp** wins.
* Older versions are removed later during **Compaction**.

---

# 1. Commit Log (Write-Ahead Log / WAL)

The **Commit Log** is the first durable write.

Before updating the Memtable, Cassandra appends the mutation to the Commit Log to guarantee durability.

Initially:

```text
CommitLog-1.log

(empty)
```

After several writes:

```text
Offset      Record

0           PUT user123 John
48          PUT user555 Alice
96          DELETE item900
```

## Characteristics

* Append-only
* Sequential disk writes
* Never modified in-place
* Extremely fast due to sequential I/O

Internally it simply performs:

```text
append()
append()
append()
append()
```

There is **no searching**, **no sorting**, and **no rewriting**.

---

# Commit Log Segments

The Commit Log is divided into multiple **Segments**.

A Segment is a physical file on disk.

By default, a segment size is approximately **32 MB** (configurable).

Example:

```text
CommitLog-1.log
CommitLog-2.log
CommitLog-3.log
```

When one segment becomes full, Cassandra creates a new segment.

Old segments are deleted only after every mutation contained within them has been safely flushed into SSTables.

---

# High-Level Commit Log Structure

```text
Commit Log
│
├── Segment 1
├── Segment 2
├── Segment 3
└── ...
```

Each Segment consists of:

```text
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| Segment Header                                               |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| Frame 1                                                      |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| Frame 2                                                      |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| Frame 3                                                      |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
```

---

# Segment Header

Every segment begins with a descriptor/header.

Typical contents include:

### Format Version

Specifies the serialization format used by this Commit Log version.

This allows newer Cassandra versions to correctly interpret older log files.

---

### Segment ID

A unique, monotonically increasing **64-bit integer** identifying the Commit Log segment.

Example:

```text
Segment ID = 348912381
```

---

### Parameters Block

Stores Commit Log configuration information such as:

* Compression type
* Encryption settings
* Other serialization parameters

---

# Frames

A **Frame** is the fundamental physical storage unit inside a Commit Log segment.

Instead of writing every Mutation directly to disk one-by-one, Cassandra groups multiple mutations into a Frame.

Therefore:

```text
Segment
    ├── Frame
    │      ├── Mutation
    │      ├── Mutation
    │      ├── Mutation
    │      └── Mutation
    │
    ├── Frame
    │      ├── Mutation
    │      ├── Mutation
    │      └── Mutation
    │
    └── Frame
```

Think of it as:

* **Segment** = Physical file on disk.
* **Frame** = Storage block inside that file.
* **Mutation** = Individual write record.

---

# Mutation Record Layout

Each Mutation stored inside a Frame contains several fields.

## 1. Size Descriptor & Metadata

```text
Mutation Length (4 bytes)
Timestamp (8 bytes)
```

The size allows Cassandra to know exactly where the next Mutation begins.

---

## 2. Serialized Mutation Payload

The payload contains the actual write information.

Typical fields include:

* Keyspace Name - like DB Name
* Partition Key (byte array)
* Table (Column Family) ID
* Row modifications
* Column Definition ID
* Cell Value (BLOB)
* Cell Flags

  * TTL
  * Tombstone
  * Expiration metadata

Conceptually:

```text
Mutation
│
├── Keyspace
├── Partition Key
├── Table ID
├── Row Updates
│      ├── Column A
│      ├── Column B
│      └── Column C
└── Metadata
```

---

# Record Trailer

Every Mutation ends with a **CRC32 checksum**.

```text
+----------------------------+
| Serialized Mutation Data   |
+----------------------------+
| CRC32 (4 Bytes)            |
+----------------------------+
```

The checksum is computed over the serialized mutation bytes.

---

# Why CRC32?

Suppose the server crashes while writing the Commit Log.

Possible result:

```text
PUT user123 John XXXXXXXX
```

The write may be only partially written.

During startup, Cassandra sequentially scans the Commit Log.

For every Mutation it:

1. Reads the serialized payload.
2. Computes a new CRC32 checksum.
3. Compares it with the stored checksum.

If they differ:

* The record is considered corrupted.
* Cassandra stops processing that portion of the Commit Log.
* This prevents replaying partially written or corrupted mutations and protects data integrity.

---

# Commit Log Hierarchy

```text

└── Segment
```

# 2. Memtable

The **Memtable** is an in-memory, sorted data structure that stores the latest write operations (**INSERT**, **UPDATE**, **DELETE**) before they are permanently flushed to disk as an SSTable.

It acts as a **write buffer** between the Commit Log and SSTables.

---

# Why Do We Need a Memtable?

Traditional **B-Tree** databases update data directly on disk.

Every write typically requires:

1. Finding the correct page.
2. Loading the page into memory.
3. Modifying it.
4. Writing the page back.

This results in **random disk I/O**, which is relatively slow.

```text
Write
   │
Find Disk Page
   │
Modify Page
   │
Random Disk Write
```

LSM-based databases (Cassandra, RocksDB, ScyllaDB, LevelDB) avoid this problem.

Instead, writes are first accumulated in an in-memory buffer called the **Memtable**.

Memory writes are several orders of magnitude faster than random disk writes.

---

# Memtable in the Write Path

After a Mutation has been successfully appended to the Commit Log (WAL), the same Mutation is inserted into the **Active Memtable**.

```text
Incoming Write
      │
      ▼
Commit Log (Durability)
      │
      ▼
Active Memtable (RAM)
      │
      ▼
Client ACK
```

The Commit Log guarantees **durability**, while the Memtable provides **fast writes and reads**.

---

# Memtable Lifecycle

A Memtable goes through three stages during its lifetime.

```text
                 Incoming Write
                       │
                       ▼
              Active Memtable
                       │
        (Size Threshold Reached)
                       │
                       ▼
            Immutable Memtable
                       │
             Background Flush
                       │
                       ▼
                  SSTable
```

### Stage 1 - Active Memtable

* Accepts all new writes.
* Maintains data in sorted order.
* Supports fast lookups.
* Lives entirely in RAM.

---

### Stage 2 - Immutable Memtable

Once the configured memory threshold is reached (for example, 32 MB, 256 MB, etc.), Cassandra:

* Marks the Memtable as **Immutable (Frozen)**.
* Stops accepting new writes.
* Creates a brand-new Active Memtable immediately.

```text
                 RAM

 Active Memtable (New)
          ▲
          │
     New Writes


 Immutable Memtable
          │
          ▼
   Waiting for Flush
```

This ensures writes continue without interruption.

---

### Stage 3 - Flush

A background thread sequentially writes the immutable Memtable to disk.

This process is called a **Flush**.

The flush creates a brand-new **SSTable**.

**Every Memtable flush creates a new SSTable.**

Existing SSTables are **never modified**.

---

# Why Create a New SSTable?

Suppose we already have:

```text
SSTable-1

user1
user2
user3
```

A new write arrives:

```text
user0
```

Appending it would break the sorted order.

```text
user1
user2
user3
user0
```

Instead, Cassandra creates another SSTable.

```text
SSTable-2

user0
```

Later, **Compaction** merges the two SSTables into a larger sorted SSTable.

---

# Internal Data Structures

A Memtable is not simply an array or a HashMap.

It must support:

* Fast insertions
* Fast lookups
* Sorted iteration
* Concurrent writes

Depending on the storage engine, different data structures are used.

| Data Structure | Used By                                        | Advantages                                                             |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Skip List      | RocksDB, LevelDB, Cassandra (earlier versions) | Lock-friendly, sorted, expected O(log n) operations                    |
| Trie           | Cassandra 5.0+                                 | Better memory efficiency, faster prefix lookups, lower memory overhead |
| Red-Black Tree | Some LSM implementations                       | Balanced tree with guaranteed O(log n) operations                      |
| B-Tree         | Some storage engines                           | Cache-friendly memory layout                                           |

---

# Skip List

A **Skip List** is a probabilistic multi-level linked list.

Instead of traversing every node one-by-one like a normal linked list, higher levels contain **express lanes** that allow searches to skip large portions of the list.

Example:

```text
Level 3

A -------------------------- H

Level 2

A -------- D -------- H

Level 1

A --- B --- C --- D --- E --- F --- G --- H
```

Searching for **G**:

```text
A
↓

Jump to D
↓

Jump to H (too far)

↓

Move back to D

↓

Traverse

E → F → G
```

Average complexity:

| Operation | Skip List         |
| --------- | ----------------- |
| Search    | O(log n)          |
| Insert    | O(log n) expected |
| Delete    | O(log n) expected |

Unlike balanced trees, Skip Lists are simpler to implement and support high concurrency.

---

# Trie (Cassandra 5.0)

Modern Cassandra versions use **Trie-indexed Memtables** by default.

A Trie stores keys character-by-character.

Example:

```text
          root
         /    \
        a      b
       /        \
      p          o
     /            \
    p              b
```

Advantages:

* Better memory utilization
* Faster lookups for common prefixes
* Reduced memory fragmentation
* Improved cache locality

---

# What Does the Memtable Actually Store?

Conceptually, a Memtable stores the **latest state** of every key (or partition in Cassandra).

For a simple Key-Value Store:

```text
user1 → John

user2 → Alice

user3 → Bob
```

For Cassandra:

```text
Partition Key

↓

Partition

↓

Rows

↓

Columns
```

A Memtable therefore stores much richer structures than simple key-value pairs.

---

# Data Representation

Every entry inside the Memtable contains more than just a key and value.

Conceptually:

| Component       | Description                                     | Example           |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| User Key        | Application-level key                           | `user123`         |
| Timestamp       | Version used for conflict resolution            | `1719694400`      |
| Value           | Serialized application data                     | `{name: "Alice"}` |
| Tombstone Flag  | Indicates whether the entry represents a delete | `true` / `false`  |
| TTL             | Time-to-Live (optional)                         | `3600 seconds`    |
| Expiration Time | Absolute expiration timestamp                   | `1719698000`      |

Notice that the Memtable stores the **latest version** of a key.

Suppose:

```text
PUT(user1, John)
```

followed by

```text
PUT(user1, Alice)
```

The Memtable contains:

```text
user1

↓

Alice
```

The older version may still exist inside an older SSTable.

During reads, Cassandra compares timestamps and returns the newest value.

---

# Memory Layout (Conceptual)

| user200 → Bob                            |
| user300 → Charlie                        |

               Disk

+------------------------------------------+
| SSTable                                  |
+------------------------------------------+
```

# Key Characteristics

* Entirely in memory.
* Stores the latest writes.
* Always maintained in sorted order.
* Supports efficient reads before data reaches disk.
* Never flushed in-place.
* Once frozen, it becomes immutable.
* Every flush creates a brand-new SSTable.
* Existing SSTables are never modified.
* Background flushing ensures writes never pause.


# 3. SSTable (Sorted String Table)

An **SSTable (Sorted String Table)** is an **immutable, sorted, on-disk data structure** that stores data permanently after it has been flushed from the Memtable.

It is the primary storage format used by Cassandra and most LSM-tree databases (ScyllaDB, RocksDB, LevelDB, HBase, etc.).

---

# Why Do We Need SSTables?

The Memtable resides entirely in RAM.

Although RAM provides extremely fast reads and writes, it is:

* Volatile (data is lost on power failure)
* Limited in size
* Expensive compared to disk storage

Eventually, the Memtable must be persisted to disk.

Instead of updating existing files, Cassandra writes the entire Memtable as a brand-new **SSTable**.

```text
Incoming Write
       │
       ▼
 Commit Log (Durability)
       │
       ▼
 Active Memtable (RAM)
       │
       ▼
 Immutable Memtable
       │
       ▼
 Background Flush
       │
       ▼
 SSTable (Disk)
```

---

# Why is it called a "Sorted String Table"?

The name originates from Google's **Bigtable** paper.

* **Sorted** → Keys are stored in sorted order.
* **String** → Historical term referring to key-value records.
* **Table** → A persistent collection of records.

Today, the keys and values are binary serialized objects—not just strings.

---

# Key Characteristics

An SSTable is:

* Immutable
* Sorted by Partition Key
* Sequentially written to disk
* Optimized for fast reads
* Never modified after creation
* Created only by flushing a Memtable

---

# SSTable Lifecycle

```text
          Active Memtable
                 │
      (Threshold Reached)
                 │
                 ▼
       Immutable Memtable
                 │
        Background Flush
                 │
                 ▼
            SSTable-1
```

Every Memtable flush creates a **new SSTable**.

Example:

```text
Flush #1

↓

SSTable-1

Flush #2

↓

SSTable-2

Flush #3

↓

SSTable-3
```

Existing SSTables are **never updated**.

---

# Why are SSTables Immutable?

Suppose we already have:

```text
SSTable-1

user1 → John
user2 → Alice
```

A new write arrives:

```text
PUT(user1, Bob)
```

Cassandra does **not** modify SSTable-1.

Instead:

```text
New Write
      │
      ▼
Memtable
      │
      ▼
Flush
      │
      ▼
SSTable-2

user1 → Bob
```

Disk now contains:

```text
SSTable-1

user1 → John


SSTable-2

user1 → Bob
```

During reads, Cassandra compares timestamps and returns the newest value.

The obsolete version is removed later during **Compaction**.

---

# Why Immutable?

Immutability provides several advantages:

* No random disk writes
* No file locking
* No in-place updates
* Readers never block writers
* Safe concurrent access
* Easy crash recovery
* Efficient sequential writes
* Simpler compaction

---

# SSTable Creation

When the Memtable reaches its configured threshold:

1. It becomes immutable.
2. A new Active Memtable is immediately created.
3. A background thread flushes the immutable Memtable.
4. The Memtable is written sequentially to disk.
5. A brand-new SSTable is created.

Since the Memtable is already sorted, **no sorting is required during the flush.**

---

# One SSTable is NOT One File

One of the biggest misconceptions is thinking that an SSTable is a single file.

It is actually a **collection of multiple files**, each serving a specific purpose.

Example:

```text
users-aa-1-Data.db
users-aa-1-Index.db
users-aa-1-Summary.db
users-aa-1-Filter.db
users-aa-1-CompressionInfo.db
users-aa-1-Statistics.db
users-aa-1-Digest.crc32
users-aa-1-TOC.txt
```

All of these files together represent **one SSTable**.

Think of it like a Java project:

```text
Java Project

├── Main.java
├── Utils.java
├── Config.java
└── pom.xml
```

Multiple files together form one logical project.

Similarly, multiple component files together form one logical SSTable.

---

# High-Level SSTable Structure

```text

│
├── Data.db
├── Index.db
├── Summary.db
├── Filter.db
├── CompressionInfo.db
├── Statistics.db
├── Digest.crc32
└── TOC.txt
```

---

# SSTable Components

## 1. Data.db

The primary storage file.

Contains:

* Partition data
* Rows
* Columns
* Cell values
* Timestamps
* TTL
* Tombstones

This is where the actual application data lives.

---

## 2. Index.db

Maps every Partition Key to its location inside **Data.db**.

Conceptually:

```text
Partition Key

↓

Disk Offset
```

Example:

```text
user100 → Offset 0

user200 → Offset 2048

user300 → Offset 4096
```

Allows Cassandra to jump directly into the data file without scanning it.

---

## 3. Summary.db

A sparse in-memory index built from **Index.db**.

Instead of loading the entire Index into memory, Cassandra stores every Nth entry.

Example:

```text
Index.db

user1
user2
user3
...
user1000
...
user2000
```

Summary:

```text
user1

↓

Index Position 0


user1000

↓

Index Position 1000


user2000

↓

Index Position 2000
```

This significantly reduces memory usage.

---

## 4. Filter.db

Stores the **Bloom Filter**.

Used to answer:

> "Could this SSTable contain this partition?"

Possible answers:

```text
NO

or

MAYBE
```

If the Bloom Filter returns **NO**, Cassandra skips the SSTable entirely.

This avoids unnecessary disk reads.

---

## 5. CompressionInfo.db

If Data.db is compressed, Cassandra must know:

* Which compressed block contains the requested partition.
* Where that block starts on disk.

CompressionInfo.db stores this metadata.

---

## 6. Statistics.db

Stores metadata about the SSTable.

Examples include:

* Number of partitions
* Minimum timestamp
* Maximum timestamp
* Tombstone count
* Compression ratio
* Minimum key
* Maximum key

Used by:

* Reads
* Compaction
* Repair
* Query optimization

---

## 7. Digest.crc32

Contains checksums for corruption detection.

During reads:

```text
Read Block

↓

Compute CRC32

↓

Compare

↓

Valid / Corrupted
```

Ensures data integrity.

---

## 8. TOC.txt

Table Of Contents.

Simply lists every component file that belongs to this SSTable.

Example:

```text
Data.db
Index.db
Summary.db
Filter.db
Statistics.db
CompressionInfo.db
Digest.crc32
```

---

# SSTable Read Flow

When Cassandra receives:

```text
GET(user123)
```

The lookup follows approximately this path:

```text
Client
   │
   ▼
Memtable
   │
   ▼
Bloom Filter (Filter.db)
   │
   ▼
Summary.db
   │
   ▼
Index.db
   │
   ▼
CompressionInfo.db
   │
   ▼
Data.db
   │
   ▼
Return Row
```

Notice that Cassandra almost never scans the entire `Data.db`. Every supporting component exists to reduce disk I/O and minimize the amount of data that must be read.

---

# Why Split an SSTable into Multiple Files?

Instead of placing everything into one large file, Cassandra separates responsibilities.

| File                   | Purpose                                            |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data.db**            | Stores the actual partition data                   |
| **Index.db**           | Maps Partition Keys to locations inside Data.db    |
| **Summary.db**         | Small in-memory sparse index into Index.db         |
| **Filter.db**          | Bloom Filter used to skip unnecessary SSTables     |
| **CompressionInfo.db** | Maps compressed blocks to disk offsets             |
| **Statistics.db**      | Stores metadata used for reads and compaction      |
| **Digest.crc32**       | Detects corruption using checksums                 |
| **TOC.txt**            | Lists all component files belonging to the SSTable |

# Key Takeaways

* SSTables are immutable, sorted files created by flushing Memtables.
* Every Memtable flush creates a brand-new SSTable.
* Existing SSTables are never modified.
* Multiple SSTables may contain different versions of the same key.
* Compaction later merges SSTables and removes obsolete data.
* An SSTable is a logical structure composed of multiple physical files, each optimized for a specific purpose in the read path.



# Data.db

`Data.db` is the **primary file inside an SSTable**. It stores the **actual application data** (partitions, rows, columns, and cell values). Every other SSTable component (`Index.db`, `Summary.db`, `Filter.db`, etc.) exists only to help Cassandra locate data inside `Data.db` efficiently.

---

## Purpose

- Stores the actual user data permanently on disk.
- Written sequentially during a Memtable flush.
- Immutable (never modified after creation).
- Optimized for sequential reads and writes.

---

## What Does Data.db Store?

Conceptually, it stores **Partitions**.

Each Partition contains:

- Partition Key
- Partition Metadata
- Rows
- Columns
- Cell Values
- Timestamps
- TTL
- Tombstones

```text
Data.db

Partition 1
│
├── Row
├── Row
└── Row

Partition 2
│
├── Row
└── Row

# 4. Index.db

`Index.db` is an **on-disk index** that maps every **Partition Key** to its corresponding location (byte offset) inside `Data.db`.

It allows Cassandra to jump directly to a partition without scanning the entire data file.

---

## Why Do We Need Index.db?

Suppose `Data.db` contains:

```text
Offset

0      Partition(user1)
500    Partition(user2)
1200   Partition(user3)
2000   Partition(user4)
```

Without an index, Cassandra would need to sequentially scan the file.

Instead, `Index.db` stores:

```text
user1 → Offset 0

user2 → Offset 500

user3 → Offset 1200

user4 → Offset 2000
```

When searching for `user3`:

```text
Partition Key
      │
      ▼
Index.db
      │
      ▼
Offset = 1200
      │
      ▼
Jump directly into Data.db
```

---

## What Does Index.db Store?

Each index entry contains:

* Partition Key
* Byte Offset inside `Data.db`

It does **not** store:

* Row data
* Column values
* Cell values

---

## How is it Created?

During a Memtable flush:

1. Cassandra writes a partition into `Data.db`.
2. Records the current file offset.
3. Stores:

```text
Partition Key → Data.db Offset
```

No second pass is required.

---

## Why Only Partition Keys?

A partition may contain thousands of rows.

Instead of indexing every row:

```text
10:00 → Offset
10:01 → Offset
10:02 → Offset
...
```

Cassandra indexes only:

```text
chat1 → Offset 5000
```

Once inside the partition, Cassandra navigates using the partition's internal row structure.

---

| ----------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Purpose     | Maps Partition Keys to Data.db offsets |
| Stores      | Partition Key + Byte Offset            |
| Mutable     | No                                     |
| Created     | During SSTable creation                |
| Used During | Every read                             |

---

# 5. Summary.db (Sparse Index)

`Summary.db` is a **small in-memory sparse index** built from `Index.db`.

Instead of loading the entire `Index.db` into RAM, Cassandra loads only **every Nth entry**.

It acts as an **index of the index**.

---

## Why Do We Need Summary.db?

Suppose `Index.db` contains:

```text
100 Million Partition Keys
```

Loading the entire file into memory would consume a huge amount of RAM.

Instead Cassandra stores:

```text
chat1

↓

Index Position 0


chat1000

↓

Index Position 1000


chat2000

↓

Index Position 2000
```

Only a small subset of entries.

---

## Read Flow

Suppose we search for:

```sql
chat1850
```

The lookup becomes:

```text
Summary.db

↓

chat1000

↓

chat2000

↓

Target lies between them

↓

Jump into Index.db

↓

Binary Search

↓

Get Data.db Offset
```

Only a small portion of `Index.db` needs to be searched.

---

## Why is it Called a Sparse Index?

Unlike `Index.db`, it does **not** store every Partition Key.

Example:

```text
Index.db

chat1
chat2
chat3
...
chat1000
...
chat2000
```

Summary.db

```text
chat1

chat1000

chat2000

chat3000
```

This significantly reduces memory consumption.

---

## Key Characteristics

| Property        | Description                                    |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |

| Loaded Into RAM | Yes                                            |
| Mutable         | No                                             |

---

# 6. Filter.db (Bloom Filter)

`Filter.db` stores the **Bloom Filter** for an SSTable.

A Bloom Filter is a **probabilistic data structure** that quickly determines whether a Partition Key **might exist** inside an SSTable.

It prevents unnecessary disk reads.

---

## Why Do We Need Bloom Filters?

Suppose a node has:

```text
100 SSTables
```

Without Bloom Filters:

```text
Read Request

↓

Open SSTable-1

↓

Open SSTable-2

↓

...

↓

Open SSTable-100
```

Most of those SSTables may not even contain the requested partition.

---

## Solution

Each SSTable has its own Bloom Filter.

```text
Read Request

↓

Bloom Filter

↓

Definitely NOT Present

↓

Skip Entire SSTable
```

or

```text
Bloom Filter

↓

Maybe Present

↓

Continue Reading
```

---

## Internal Structure

A Bloom Filter consists of:

* Bit Array
* Multiple Hash Functions

Example:

```text
Bit Array

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
```

Insert:

```text
user123
```

Hash Functions produce:

```text
2

5

8
```

Set those bits:

```text
0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0
```

---

## Lookup

Search:

```text
user500
```

Hashes:

```text
2

5

8
```

All bits are 1.

Bloom Filter returns:

```text
Maybe Present
```

Search:

```text
user999
```

Hashes:

```text
1

4

8
```

Bit 4 is 0.

Bloom Filter immediately returns:

```text
Definitely NOT Present
```

No disk access required.

---

## False Positives

Two different keys may hash to the same bit positions.

Example:

```text
user123

↓

2,5,8
```

```text
user500

↓

2,5,8
```

Bloom Filter reports:

```text
Maybe Present
```

even though `user500` was never inserted.

This is called a **False Positive**.

---

## False Negatives?

Never.

If any required bit is 0:

```text
Hash1 → 2 → 1

Hash2 → 5 → 0

Hash3 → 8 → 1
```

The key definitely does not exist.

Therefore:

* False Positives → Possible
* False Negatives → Impossible

# 7. Compaction

Compaction is a **background process** that merges multiple SSTables into a new SSTable while removing obsolete or unnecessary data.

Since SSTables are immutable, updates and deletes create new SSTables instead of modifying existing ones. Over time, multiple SSTables accumulate, making reads slower. Compaction solves this problem.

---

## Why Do We Need Compaction?

Every Memtable flush creates a new SSTable.

```text
Memtable Flush #1
        │
        ▼
SSTable-1

Memtable Flush #2
        │
        ▼
SSTable-2

Memtable Flush #3
        │
        ▼
SSTable-3
```

Eventually a node may contain hundreds of SSTables.

Without compaction:

- Reads become slower.
- Multiple versions of the same key exist.
- Deleted data (tombstones) continue occupying space.

---

## What Does Compaction Do?

Compaction:

- Reads multiple SSTables.
- Merges sorted data.
- Keeps only the newest version of each partition.
- Removes obsolete versions.
- Removes expired TTL data.
- Removes tombstones (after `gc_grace_seconds`).
- Writes a brand-new SSTable.
- Deletes the old SSTables.

---

## Example

Before Compaction

```text
SSTable-1

user1 → John
user2 → Alice

----------------

SSTable-2

user1 → Bob
user3 → David
```

After Compaction

```text
SSTable-3

user1 → Bob
user2 → Alice
user3 → David
```

Old SSTables are deleted.

---

## Compaction Process

```text
SSTable-1
      │
SSTable-2
      │
SSTable-3
      │
      ▼
Background Compaction
      │
      ▼
Merged SSTable
      │
      ▼
Delete Old SSTables
```

---

## Why is it Efficient?

SSTables are already sorted.

Compaction performs a merge similar to the merge step of Merge Sort.

Example

```text
SSTable-1

1
4
8

------------

SSTable-2

2
3
7
```

Merge

```text
1
2
3
4
7
8
```

Time Complexity: **O(n)**

---

## What Gets Removed?

### 1. Older Versions

```text
user1 → John

user1 → Alice
```

Keep:

```text
user1 → Alice
```

---

### 2. Expired TTL Data

Expired cells are discarded during compaction.

---

### 3. Tombstones

Deletes are stored as tombstones.

Once the tombstone has existed longer than `gc_grace_seconds` and all replicas are expected to have received it, compaction permanently removes:

- Tombstone
- Original deleted data

---

## Read Amplification

More SSTables means more SSTables to check during reads.

Compaction reduces read amplification.

---

## Write Amplification

Compaction rewrites existing data into new SSTables.

Even unchanged data is rewritten.

This increases disk writes.

---

## Space Amplification

During compaction:

```text
Old SSTables
        +
New SSTable
```

Both exist temporarily, requiring additional disk space.

---

## Compaction Strategies

### 1. Size-Tiered Compaction Strategy (STCS)

- Merges SSTables of similar size.
- Optimized for write-heavy workloads.
- Default strategy for many workloads.

---

### 2. Leveled Compaction Strategy (LCS)

- Organizes SSTables into multiple levels.
- Reduces read amplification.
- Higher write amplification.

Best for read-heavy workloads.

---

### 3. Time Window Compaction Strategy (TWCS)

- Groups SSTables by time windows.
- Ideal for time-series data.
- Efficient handling of TTL expiration.

---

## Trade-offs

| Benefit | Cost |
|---------|------|
| Faster Reads | Write Amplification |
| Fewer SSTables | Additional CPU |
| Removes Old Versions | Temporary Disk Usage |
| Removes Tombstones | Additional Disk I/O |

---

## Key Characteristics

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Purpose | Merge SSTables and remove obsolete data |
| Runs | Background |
| Input | Multiple SSTables |
| Output | One or more new SSTables |
| Removes | Older versions, expired data, tombstones |
| Modifies Existing SSTables | No |
| Benefit | Faster reads and reclaimed disk space |

## Interview Takeaways

- SSTables are **immutable**.
- Every Memtable flush creates a **new SSTable**.
- Compaction **never updates an SSTable in place**.
- Compaction merges SSTables using a **linear merge** because they are already sorted.
- It removes obsolete versions, expired TTL data, and eligible tombstones.
- The three major trade-offs are:
  - Read Amplification
  - Write Amplification
  - Space Amplification
 
# 8. Write Path

The write path is the sequence of steps Cassandra follows to persist a write request.

---

## Step-by-Step

### 1. Client Request

```sql
INSERT INTO users(user_id,name)
VALUES(123,'John');
```

---

### 2. Coordinator Node

The client can connect to **any node**.

That node becomes the **Coordinator**.

Responsibilities:

- Parse request.
- Create Mutation.
- Find replica nodes.
- Coordinate acknowledgements.

---

### 3. Compute Token

Coordinator extracts the **Partition Key**.

```text
Partition Key

↓

Murmur3 Hash

↓

Token
```

---

### 4. Find Replica Nodes

Using the Token Ring:

```text
Token

↓

Replica Nodes
```

Replication Factor determines how many replicas receive the write.

---

### 5. Send Mutation

Coordinator forwards the Mutation to every replica.

---

### 6. Local Write

Each replica performs:

```text
Mutation

↓

Commit Log (Durability)

↓

Memtable (Fast Reads)
```

Commit Log and Memtable are updated almost simultaneously.

---

### 7. Acknowledgement

Replicas acknowledge according to the requested Consistency Level.

Example:

Replication Factor = 3

Consistency = QUORUM

Required ACKs = 2

---

### 8. Background Flush

When Memtable reaches its threshold:

```text
Memtable

↓

Immutable

↓

Flush

↓

SSTable
```

---

### 9. Background Compaction

Later:

```text
SSTable-1

SSTable-2

SSTable-3

↓

Compaction

↓

Merged SSTable
```

---

## Components Used

- Coordinator
- Partition Key
- Murmur3 Hash
- Token Ring
- Replica Nodes
- Mutation
- Commit Log
- Memtable
- SSTable
- Compaction

---

## Key Characteristics

- Writes are append-only.
- Commit Log guarantees durability.
- Memtable provides fast writes.
- SSTables are created asynchronously.
- Compaction is asynchronous.


# 9. Read Path

The read path retrieves the latest version of a partition from Memtables and SSTables.

Unlike writes, reads may consult multiple SSTables.

---

## Step-by-Step

### 1. Client Request

```sql
SELECT *

FROM users

WHERE user_id=123;
```

---

### 2. Coordinator Node

The node receiving the request becomes the Coordinator.

---

### 3. Compute Token

```text
Partition Key

↓

Hash

↓

Token
```

---

### 4. Find Replica Nodes

Coordinator determines which replicas own the partition.

---

### 5. Read Memtable

Always check Memtable first.

Latest writes may not yet be flushed.

---

### 6. Bloom Filter (Filter.db)

Question:

```text
Does this SSTable possibly contain this partition?
```

Possible answers:

```text
NO
```

↓

Skip SSTable

or

```text
MAYBE
```

↓

Continue

---

### 7. Summary.db

Small in-memory sparse index.

Finds approximately where the partition lies inside Index.db.

---

### 8. Index.db

Maps

```text
Partition Key

↓

Byte Offset
```

inside Data.db.

---

### 9. Data.db

Jump directly to the partition.

Read:

- Partition
- Rows
- Columns
- Cell Values

---

### 10. Merge Results

Data may exist in:

- Memtable
- SSTable-1
- SSTable-2
- SSTable-3

Cassandra compares timestamps.

Newest version wins.

---

### 11. Read Repair (Optional)

If replicas return different versions:

```text
Replica A

↓

Version 5

Replica B

↓

Version 3
```

Coordinator repairs stale replicas.

---

### 12. Return Result

Coordinator sends the newest version to the client.

---

## Components Used

- Coordinator
- Token Ring
- Replica
- Memtable
- Bloom Filter
- Summary.db
- Index.db
- Data.db
- Timestamp Comparison
- Read Repair

---

## Key Characteristics

- Memtable is checked first.
- Bloom Filters avoid unnecessary SSTable reads.
- Summary.db reduces Index.db search.
- Index.db locates partitions.
- Data.db stores actual data.
- Results from multiple SSTables are merged.
- Latest timestamp wins.
